In this project, Weâ€™ll be integrating razorpay in flutter app and flutter web. And, to avoid auto refund of payment we will auto-capture payments by making call to razorpay order api.

### Why this project?
##### 1) Same code base for razorpay in flutter app and web
##### 2) 2 different ways to trigger razorpay order api
##### 3) No web support for razorpay by official plugin yet
